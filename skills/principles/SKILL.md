# Principles

Twenty-one rules, each small enough to hold in your head and specific enough
to change a decision. Every entry names the situation it applies to.

**Read the leaf in full before you cite it.** A citation with no decision
behind it means you skipped the file. It has to trace to a real choice the
leaf's rule drove.

## Core

- **[Laziness Protocol](laziness-protocol.md)**. Apply when refactoring, evaluating diff size, or tempted to add abstractions, layers, or signal threading. Bias toward deletion and the smallest change that solves the problem.
- **[Foundational Thinking](foundational-thinking.md)**. Apply before writing logic: choosing core types and data structures, sequencing scaffold-vs-feature work, asking what concurrent actors share. Get the data structures right so downstream code becomes obvious.
- **[Redesign From First Principles](redesign-from-first-principles.md)**. Apply when integrating a new requirement into an existing design. Redesign as if the requirement had been a foundational assumption from day one, instead of bolting it on.
- **[Subtract Before You Add](subtract-before-you-add.md)**. Apply when sequencing an addition, refactor, or rewrite. Remove dead weight, redundant validators, and stub references first, then build on the simpler base.
- **[Minimize Reader Load](minimize-reader-load.md)**. Apply when reviewing or shaping code that's hard to trace. Count layers between question and answer, and hidden state in the reader's head; collapse one-caller wrappers and shrink mutable scope.
- **[Outcome-Oriented Execution](outcome-oriented-execution.md)**. Apply during planned rewrites and migrations with explicit phase boundaries. Converge on the target architecture; don't preserve smooth intermediate states with throwaway compatibility code.
- **[Experience First](experience-first.md)**. Apply when product, UX, or feature-scope tradeoffs come up. Choose user delight over implementation convenience; ship fewer polished features over more rough ones.
- **[Exhaust the Design Space](exhaust-the-design-space.md)**. Apply when facing a novel UI interaction or architectural decision with no precedent in the codebase. Build 2-3 competing prototypes and compare side by side before committing.
- **[Build the Lever](build-the-lever.md)**. Apply to any non-trivial work, not just bulk work: edits, migrations, analyses, checks. Build the tool that does it or proves it (codemod, script, generator, or a skill your subagents follow) instead of working by hand. The tool is the artifact a reviewer can rerun.

## Architecture

- **[Model the Domain](model-the-domain.md)**. Apply when writing stateful logic, or when code branches a lot or repeats a shape assumption across files. Encode the domain in a structure instead of scattered conditionals.
- **[Boundary Discipline](boundary-discipline.md)**. Apply when wiring validation, error handling, or framework adapters. Concentrate guards at system boundaries (CLI, config, network, external APIs); trust internal types and keep business logic in pure functions.
- **[Type System Discipline](type-system-discipline.md)**. Apply when designing types, reviewing a function signature, or writing code in any statically-typed language. Make illegal states unrepresentable, brand semantic primitives, parse external data at boundaries, refuse to lie to the compiler, exhaust variants, derive from authoritative schemas.
- **[Make Operations Idempotent](make-operations-idempotent.md)**. Apply when designing commands, lifecycle steps, or processing loops that run amid crashes, restarts, and retries. Converge to the same end state regardless of partial prior runs.
- **[Migrate Callers Then Delete Legacy APIs](migrate-callers-then-delete-legacy-apis.md)**. Apply when introducing a new internal API while old callers still exist. Migrate callers and delete the old API in the same wave instead of preserving compatibility layers.
- **[Separate Before Serializing Shared State](separate-before-serializing-shared-state.md)**. Apply when concurrent actors might write to the same file, branch, key, or state object. Eliminate the sharing first; serialize structurally only when one shared writer is a real invariant.

## Verification

- **[Prove It Works](prove-it-works.md)**. Apply after completing a task, before declaring done. Verify against the real artifact (run the feature, read the actual value, inspect the diff), not a proxy, self-report, or 'it compiles.'
- **[Fix Root Causes](fix-root-causes.md)**. Apply when debugging. Trace each symptom to its root cause and fix it there; reproduce first, ask why until you reach it, resist nil-check guards that silence crashes.
- **[Sequence work into verifiable units](sequence-verifiable-units.md)**. Apply to multi-step work (sweeps, migrations, runs of similar edits) and to how you stack commits and PRs. Break work into small units that each end in a verifiable state, check each before the next, and order delivery so the sequence proves itself to a reviewer.

## Delegation

- **[Guard the Context Window](guard-the-context-window.md)**. Apply when context is filling up: large outputs, long files, repeated reads, fan-out planning. Route bulk to subagents; keep summaries in the main thread, not raw payloads.
- **[Never Block on the Human](never-block-on-the-human.md)**. Apply when tempted to ask 'should I do X?' on reversible work. Proceed, present the result, let the human course-correct after the fact; reserve confirmation for irreversible actions.

## Meta

- **[Encode Lessons in Structure](encode-lessons-in-structure.md)**. Apply when you catch yourself writing the same instruction a second time, or notice a recurring correction. Encode the rule as a lint, metadata flag, runtime check, or script instead of more text.
