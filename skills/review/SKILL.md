# Review

Three axes over one diff, run as parallel sub-agents so they cannot pollute
each other's context, then one lead judgment over everything they return.

The axes are orthogonal on purpose. A change can pass any one and fail another:

- Follows every convention, implements the wrong thing. **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Does exactly what the ticket asked, breaks the project's conventions. **Spec pass, Standards fail.**
- Correct and conventional, falls over on an input nobody considered. **Both pass, Adversarial fail.**

Reporting them separately is what stops one axis masking another.

**Not the built-in `/code-review`.** That one is fast, focused on correctness
bugs, and can post to a PR. Reach for it on routine changes. Reach for this
when the change is contested, architectural, or about to land somewhere
expensive to undo.

The deliverable is a verdict. **Do not auto-apply changes.**

## 1. Pin the scope

Whatever fixed point the user gave: a SHA, branch, tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`. If
they gave none, use the merge-base against the default branch and say so.

```bash
git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD          # three-dot: compares against merge-base
git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline
```

Confirm the ref resolves (`git rev-parse`) and the diff is non-empty **before**
spawning anything. A bad ref should fail here, not three times in parallel.

For a diff whose blast radius is unclear, `search_graph` and `trace_path` from
`codebase-memory` find the call sites the diff affects, so the Standards axis
can see past the changed lines. Fall back to `grep` when the graph has no
entry for this repo.

## 2. State the intent

One clear paragraph: what is this change trying to accomplish? Derive it from
the user's message, the commit messages, the PR description, the code itself.

Reviewers challenge whether the work **achieves** the intent, not whether the
intent is right. If you cannot state it, ask before proceeding: an unstated
intent produces three reviews of three different imagined changes.

## 3. Gather the axis inputs

- **Standards sources.** Anything in-repo documenting how code should be written: `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, ADRs touching the area. Plus [SMELLS.md](SMELLS.md), which applies even when the repo documents nothing.
- **Spec source**, in this order: issue references in the commits (`#123`, `Closes #45`), a path the user passed, a spec under `docs/`, `specs/`, or `.scratch/` matching the branch. If nothing is found, ask. If the user says there is no spec, the Spec axis reports "no spec available" and is skipped.

## 4. Spawn the three axes in parallel

One message, three `Agent` calls, `run_in_background: true`. Each gets the diff
command, the commit list, and only its own inputs.

| Axis | Model | Brief |
|---|---|---|
| Standards | `sonnet` | "Report, per file or hunk: (a) every place the diff violates a documented standard, citing the standard file and the rule; (b) any baseline smell, named, with the hunk quoted. Distinguish hard violations from judgement calls: documented-standard breaches can be hard, baseline smells never are, and a documented repo standard overrides the baseline. Skip anything tooling enforces. Under 400 words." Paste SMELLS.md in full; the sub-agent has no other access to it. |
| Spec | `sonnet` | "Report: (a) requirements the spec asked for that are missing or partial; (b) behaviour in the diff nobody asked for (scope creep); (c) requirements that look implemented but look wrong. Quote the spec line for each finding. Under 400 words." |
| Adversarial | `opus` and `fable`, one each | Fill [reviewer-prompt.md](reviewer-prompt.md) with the intent, the diff, [rubric.md](rubric.md), and [code-quality-review.md](code-quality-review.md). |

**On the adversarial axis.** Its signal comes from model diversity, not from
assigned personas, so run it on at least two different models. Be honest about
the ceiling: every model available here is a Claude model, so this is weaker
than a genuine cross-vendor panel. Two models agreeing is good evidence, not
proof. One model alone is a single opinion with extra steps.

## 5. Synthesize

1. Parse all findings.
2. **Consensus first.** Anything two or more reviewers raised independently is the highest signal in the run.
3. **Lone findings** still get read, weighted lower.
4. **Deduplicate.** Different reviewers describe the same issue differently. Merge them, noting who raised it.
5. **Note disagreements.** One reviewer flagging what another explicitly cleared is itself useful context.

## 6. Rule on it as lead

You are a pragmatic senior engineer, not a neutral aggregator. Read
[lead-judgment.md](lead-judgment.md) for the full framework.

The reviewers each saw a slice. You have the goal, the constraints, the
timeline, and which tradeoffs were already settled. Use that aggressively.
Every finding lands in exactly one bucket:

- **Act on.** Real, affects correctness, security, or maintainability given the actual goals. Would block a real PR.
- **Consider.** Legitimate, but you are not sure it outweighs the cost right now. Worth the user's attention.
- **Noted.** Valid but not actionable. Context-dependent, premature, or low-impact at this stage.
- **Dismissed.** Wrong, nitpicky, or missing context. Say briefly why.

## Output

```
### Intent
> the paragraph from step 2

### Axes
- Standards: N findings
- Spec: N findings (or "no spec available")
- Adversarial (<model>, <model>): N findings

### Act on
### Consider
### Noted
### Dismissed
```

Each finding names which axis and which model raised it, and carries a one-line
rationale for its bucket. Report Standards and Spec counts separately and never
rank one against the other; that reranking is exactly what the separation
exists to prevent.

Close with an **Agreement map**: where the reviewers converged, where they
split, and what that pattern says about confidence.
